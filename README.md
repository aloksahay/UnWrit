# Sozu Hackathon 2025

Unwrit solves the problem of outdated, biased, and censored narratives in museums and historical sites. 
Traditional audioguides often present highly controlled stories, avoiding controversial topics.
Unwrit provides an AI-driven alternative that allows visitors to ask hard questions and receive uncensored, truthful responses. 
Unlike government-regulated AI or politically correct commercial platforms, Unwrit ensures historical transparency, since the content comes straight from historical content creators.

Built using Fileverse, Game and Venice AI.
